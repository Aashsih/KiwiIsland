Code Improvements
------------------
1. Setters do not have any boundary checks -- ther are some boundary checks for the Position class so might not be a valid point (needs more investigation).
2. The different Occupants (eg: Fauna, Food, Hazard, Kiwi), have a letter that they are represented by. These letters need to be defined in a better way as opposed a String literal in the getStringRepresentation() method.
3. In the Hazard class, there is mention of "Break Trap". This should not be used as a String literal. Also the method isBreakTrap() uses this string literal.
4. In the Tool class, there are two literals: "Trap" and "Screwdriver", these need to be defined either as constants or made into objects.

5. "Game": in the method getPlayerValues() an int array of size "6" is created. This number should not be used in literal form. Could cause trouble when changes are made to the player's attributes.

Observations:
1. In the Postion class the "island" attribute is initialized only when the the row and column value are valid.

2. Row value increases as one moves down
   Column value increases as you move East
   
3. Any new occupant ie a Species should be created as an object that extends "Fauna"

4. GridSquare "has a player" -- this might not be the best implementation as a GridSquare could potentially have a player but it is not a property of a GridSquare. (This might be necessary though)

The way I see it, the GridSquare should have a boolean to check if it has a "Player".

Also, the GridSquare shold probably have "Postion" as well.

5. GridSquare: Some methods should probably not be public eg: setVisible(), setExplored() etc. 
These methods should be triggered by an event that is driven by the player and should be set to "true" or "false" only when that happens.

6. Player name can be anything right now. It should probably not be nullable.

7. "Player": Stamina needed to make a move is based on 
	a: Minimum stamina to make a move
	b: load (1+ currentWeight/total weight)
	c: terrain Difficulty.
Note: MOVE_STAMINA should always be greater than 0.

8. Player can have only one trap in their bagpack.
